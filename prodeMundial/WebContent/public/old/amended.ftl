It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Trust created under this Agreement constitutes a statutory trust under the Act and that this Agreement, together with each Supplemental Agreement, constitutes the entire "governing instrument" (as defined in the Act) of such Trust.

				(b)Duties of Trustee.  It shall be the sole duty of the Trustee to discharge (or cause to be discharged) only those duties expressly required to be performed by the Trustee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

The Trustee, on behalf of the Administrator and the Trust shall: (i) hold (directly or indirectly, including, without limitation, through a nominee or otherwise), in separate and distinct records maintained for each Series, one or more Policies, as have been delivered to the Trustee, allocated to such Series, separately from the other assets of the Trust or any other Series; and (ii) maintain as separate and distinct records for each Series: (A) a Series Register, prepared by or on the basis of information provided by or on behalf of the Administrator, identifying the Plan Participant(s) of such Series; (B) each Policy, as has been delivered to the Trustee, allocated to such Series; and (C) such other records pertaining to such Series (including the original or a copy of the Supplemental Agreement relating to such Series and any amendment thereto) as may be presented to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Sponsor, the Administrator, or a Plan Participant.  The Trustee, when acting pursuant to written direction by or on behalf of the Sponsor or the Administrator pursuant to Section 3.1(e) or (f), Section 4.1(a) or (b), Section 4.2, Section 6.2, or Section 7.2, shall be acting solely at the request of the Sponsor or the Administrator or a delegatee thereof and shall not have independent power or authority or Control to make Substantial Decisions regarding the Trust.<br>
				(c)Duties of Administrator.  Subject to the limitations provided in this Agreement, the  Administrator shall have full and exclusive power and authority, not as delegatee of the Trustee but as the agent of the Trust, to carry out the purposes of the Trust.  The Administrator has the power and authority and is hereby authorized and empowered to, and may, delegate to one or more other Persons the Administrator"s powers, authority, authorization, duties, and discretion under this Agreement and otherwise (including, without limitation, the Administrator"s powers, authority, authorization, duties, and discretion in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for any Relevant Series Plan Participant(s) (as defined in the relevant Supplemental Agreement)), including, without limitation, to delegate to agents, officers, and employees of the Administrator or the Trust, and to delegate by management agreement or other agreement with, or otherwise to, one or more other Persons.  Such delegation by the Administrator shall not cause the Administrator to cease to be Administrator of the Trust or cause any Person to whom any such powers, authority, authorization, duties, and discretion have been delegated to be the Administrator.  An action taken by or on behalf of the Administrator in accordance with its powers shall constitute the act of and serve to bind the Trust. In dealing with the Administrator acting on behalf of the Trust, no Person shall be required to inquire into the authority of the Administrator to bind the Trust.  Persons dealing with the Trust are entitled to rely conclusively on the power and authority of the Administrator as set forth in this Agreement.  <br>
				(d)No Implied Powers or Duties of Trustee.  The Trustee shall not have any right, power, duty or obligation to take or refrain from taking any action under or in connection with this Agreement or the Trust or any Series, except as expressly so provided by the terms of this Agreement or as expressly directed in written instructions pursuant to Section 3.1(e) or (f), Section 4.1(a) or (b), Section 4.2, Section 6.2, or Section 7.2 hereof, and no implied powers, duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Trustee, and no power or authority of the Trustee shall be construed as a duty. The Trustee shall not be required to take or refrain from taking any action under this Agreement or any document to which it or the Trust is a party unless the Trustee (in its individual capacity and as Trustee) shall have been indemnified and held harmless by the Trust, the Sponsor, and/or ITA in manner and form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, against any liability, fee, obligation, damage, loss, penalty, tax (excluding any taxes payable by the Trustee on or measured by any compensation for services rendered by the Trustee under this Agreement), claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, cost, disbursement or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of defending itself against any claim of liability) that may be incurred or charged in connection therewith. The Trustee shall not be required to take or refrain from any action if the Trustee shall reasonably determine, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action or inaction is likely to result in personal liability, or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any document contemplated hereby to which the Trust or the Trustee is a party, or is otherwise contrary to law.<br>
				(e)Right to Receive Instructions.  In the event that the Trustee is unable to decide between alternative courses of action, or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this Agreement or any other document, or believes such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that this Agreement or any other document permits any determination by the Trustee or is silent or is incomplete as to the course of action which the Trustee may or is required to take with respect to a particular set of facts, the Trustee may give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Sponsor or the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator requesting instructions and, to the extent that the Trustee shall have acted or refrained from acting in good faith in accordance with any instructions received from the Sponsor or the Administrator or such a delegatee, the Trustee shall not be personally liable on account of such action or inaction to any Person.  If the Trustee shall not have received appropriate written instructions within ten days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as may be specified in such notice) the Trustee may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action as the Trustee shall deem to be in the best interests of the Relevant Series Plan Participant(s), and the Trustee shall have no personal liability to any Person for such action or inaction.  <br>
				(f)Furnishing of Documents.  Unless directed otherwise in writing by or on behalf of the Administrator, the Trustee shall furnish to the Administrator, promptly upon receipt thereof, a duplicate or copy of all reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates, documents, financial statements and any other instruments furnished to the Trustee and relating to the Trust, this Agreement, or the Trust Property, provided that the Trustee need not forward documents to the Administrator if the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator originated the documents or furnished them to the Trustee or is to receive any such documents from any Person other than the Trustee.<br>
				(g)Subscription by Plan Participants.  The Trust shall enter into a Subscription Agreement with each Plan Participant substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D; provided, however, that the Trust shall not enter into a Subscription Agreement with a prospective Plan Participant who is a citizen or resident of the United States of America or a corporation or other entity deemed situated in the United States of America under the tax laws and Regulations of the United States of America or who is physically present in the United States of America for a number of days in a taxable year which would result in it being taxable as a resident alien under the "substantial presence" test of Section 7701(b) of the Code; and provided further, that the Trust shall not enter into any Subscription Agreement with a prospective Plan Participant if the Insurance Company has not determined to accept the Application for Supplemental Insurance Policy submitted by such prospective Plan Participant and has not determined to issue a Policy pursuant to such Application; and provided further, that the Trust shall not enter into any Subscription Agreement with a prospective Plan Participant if the Trustee reasonably objects thereto (including without limitation, in connection with the Trustee's compliance with its obligations under applicable law and regulations) within a reasonable period following notice from the Administrator.  By execution and delivery of a Subscription Agreement, a prospective Plan Participant applies to the Trust for participation in the Plan and admission as a beneficial owner with respect to a Series, and the Trust, at the sole discretion of the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator (subject to the provisos in the preceding sentence), shall be free to accept or reject such application in its sole discretion.  If the Trust accepts the application as determined by the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator, then the Administrator, or a delegatee of the Administrator, on behalf of the Trust shall execute the Supplemental Agreement relating to the particular Series of and with respect to which such Plan Participant is admitted as and becomes a beneficial owner of the Trust (or take action that is deemed to constitute such execution and delivery of such Supplemental Agreement) and such execution (or action that is deemed to constitute such execution)  shall evidence and constitute such acceptance.  For all purposes of this Agreement, each Supplemental Agreement, and each Subscription Agreement, any Electronic Signature by the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator with respect to such Supplemental Agreement shall be deemed to constitute such Person"s acceptance, execution and delivery on behalf of the Trust of the Supplemental Agreement relating to the particular Series of and with respect to which a Plan Participant is admitted as and becomes a beneficial owner of the Trust.<br>
				 (h)Plan Participants Bound.  A Person shall be admitted as and become a beneficial owner of the Trust with respect to a Series, and shall become bound by this Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement establishing such Series, if such Person (or a representative authorized by such Person orally, in writing or by other action such as payment for a beneficial interest) (i) executes and delivers (or takes action that is deemed to constitute execution and delivery of)  a Subscription Agreement that is accepted by the Trust, or (ii) complies with the conditions for becoming a beneficial owner set forth in such Subscription Agreement and acquires a beneficial interest of such Series, such Person to be admitted as and become a beneficial owner with respect to such Series, and to become bound by this Agreement and such Supplemental Agreement, effective upon the execution and delivery (or upon the taking of action that is deemed to constitute execution and delivery)  of such Supplemental Agreement by the Trust, the Trustee, and the Administrator (or a delegatee of the Administrator) as such and as attorney-in-fact of such Person.  For all purposes of this Agreement, each Supplemental Agreement, and each Subscription Agreement, any Electronic Signature by a Person with respect to such Subscription Agreement , or a Person's compliance with the conditions for becoming a beneficial owner set forth in such Subscription Agreement and acquisition of a beneficial interest of such Series, shall be deemed to constitute such Person's acceptance, execution and delivery of a Subscription Agreement.  For all purposes of this Agreement, each Supplemental Agreement, and each Subscription Agreement, any Electronic Signature with respect to such Supplemental Agreement, by the Trust, the Trustee, or the Administrator (or a delegatee of the Administrator) as such or as attorney-in-fact of a Person who is to be admitted as and become a beneficial owner with respect to a Series, shall be deemed to constitute such Person's acceptance, execution and delivery of the Supplemental Agreement establishing such Series.  <br>
				 (i)Whenever used herein, unless the context otherwise requires:  (1) "Electronic" means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic or similar capabilities; (2) "Electronic Record" means a Record created, generated, sent, communicated, received or stored by Electronic means; (3) "Electronic Signature" means an Electronic sound, symbol or process attached to or logically associated with a Record and executed or adopted by a Person with the intent to sign the Record; (4) "Information Processing System" means an Electronic system for creating, generating, sending, receiving, storing, displaying or processing information; (5) "Record" means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an Electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form; (6) "Responsible Officer of the Trustee" means any officer in the office of the Trustee located at the address of the Trustee under Section 7.14 of this Agreement who shall have direct responsibility for the administration of this Agreement; and (7) "Security Procedure" means a procedure employed for the purpose of verifying that an Electronic Signature, Record or performance is that of a specific Person or for detecting changes or errors in the information in an Electronic Record, and includes a procedure that requires the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, or callback or other acknowledgment procedures.  For purposes of this Agreement, each Supplemental Agreement, and each Subscription Agreement: (8) an Electronic Record or Electronic Signature is attributable to a Person if it was the act of or on behalf of the Person, and such act may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any Security Procedure applied to determine the Person to which the Electronic Record or Electronic Signature was attributable; and (9) an Electronic Record is received by a Person only when: (A) it enters an Information Processing System that such Person previously has designated in a writing to the sender for the purpose of receiving from such sender Electronic Records of the type received and from which such Person is able to retrieve the Electronic Record; (B) it is in a form capable of being processed by that system; and (C) a responsible officer of such Person (in the case of the Trustee, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee) has actual knowledge of its receipt.  Receipt of an Electronic acknowledgment from an Information Processing System by itself does not establish that a Record was received and does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.<br>

				ARTICLE IV - SERIES <br>
				<br>
				Section 4.1 Establishment and Designation of Series.   <br>
				(a)Upon the Trust"s acceptance of a Subscription Agreement delivered by a new Plan Participant or as otherwise determined by or on behalf of the Sponsor in its sole discretion from time to time, a designated Series shall be established by a Supplemental Agreement.  The Trustee, upon written direction of or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee, and the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator, in its capacity as such, as attorney-in-fact for the Relevant Series Plan Participant, and in the name and on behalf of the Trust, shall execute (or take action that is deemed to constitute execution of)  a Supplemental Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, establishing a Series.  For all purposes under this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, (i) with respect to the rights of creditors and (ii) for purposes of interpreting the relative rights of the Plan Participants, each Series shall have such separate rights, powers and/or duties with respect to its Specified Assets and Specified Obligations, and may have a separate business purpose or investment objective, and each Series shall have such relative rights, powers, and duties (including, without limitation, rights, powers, and duties senior or subordinate to existing Series), as shall be set forth in the relevant Supplemental Agreement. The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series only, and not against the assets of the Trust generally or of any other Series, and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust generally or any other Series shall be enforceable against the assets of such Series.  Separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each and every Series, and the assets associated with any such Series shall be held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including, without limitation, through a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the assets of the Trust generally or of any other Series, in accordance with the Act.  The Certificate of Trust shall set forth notice of the limitation on liabilities of a Series in accordance with the Act.  The assets of one Series shall not be commingled with the assets of any other Series or with the assets of the Trust generally.  Any creditor of any Series shall look only to the assets of that Series to satisfy such creditor"s claim.  The "governing instrument" (within the meaning of the Act) of each Series shall be this Agreement and the corresponding Supplemental Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, a direction to the Trustee (i) that is in the form of an e-mail, that is sent by or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee and is actually received by the Trustee at an e-mail address of the Trustee previously provided by the Trustee to the Administrator or its delegatee, and of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, or (ii) that is in the form of an Electronic Record which the Trustee previously has consented in writing to receive from the Administrator or its delegatee, and that is sent by or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee and is actually received by the Trustee, shall be deemed to be a written direction of or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee.<br>
				(b)The Series Registers identifying the Plan Participants for each Series shall be updated from time to time by the Trustee, solely upon the written direction of or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee, from time to time, including, without limitation, upon the establishment, designation and issuance of additional Series and the admission of additional Plan Participants as beneficial owners with respect to a Series, as necessary to reflect accurately the information contained therein.  Any revision to such Series Registers made in accordance with this Agreement shall not be deemed an amendment to this Agreement.  Any reference in this Agreement to such Series Registers shall be deemed to be a reference to such Series Registers as amended and in effect from time to time.<br>
				(c)All Specified Assets of a particular Series, and any and all consideration received by the Trust from the issue or sale of Interests of that particular Series, together with all assets in which such consideration is invested or reinvested, and all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, shall be assets of, for, held with respect to, associated with, and specific to such Series.  Such Specified Assets, consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, in whatever form the same may be, together with any General Assets (as hereinafter defined) allocated to such a particular Series as provided in the following sentence, are herein referred to as "assets belonging to" such Series.  In the event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, funds, or payments that are not readily identifiable as assets belonging to any particular Series (collectively, "General Assets"), the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator may allocate such General Assets to, between, or among any one or more Series in such manner and on such basis as the Administrator or such a delegatee, in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, any General Assets so allocated to a particular Series shall belong to that Series and that Series only and each such allocation by or on behalf of the Administrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the Trust, all Series and all holders of Interests for all purposes.  Assets belonging to a Series shall be held (to the extent permitted by law directly or indirectly, including, without limitation, through a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for separately from the other assets of the Trust, or any other Series, by or on behalf of the Administrator, in accordance with the Act.  Separate and distinct records shall be maintained, by or on behalf of the Administrator, for each Series and the assets belonging to such Series and the liabilities belonging to such Series.<br>
				(d)The assets belonging to each particular Series shall be charged exclusively with the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to that Series (including, without limitation, obligations under Section 5.3 of this Agreement and all Specified Obligations of that particular Series), and charges and reserves attributable to that Series, if any.  All such debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series (including, without limitation, all Specified Obligations of that particular Series), and all such charges and reserves attributable to that Series, together with any General Liabilities (as hereinafter defined) allocated to such particular Series as provided in the following sentence, are herein referred to as "liabilities belonging to" that Series.  In the event that there are any debts, liabilities, obligations, or expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust, or any charges or reserves attributable to the Trust, that are not readily identifiable as liabilities belonging to any particular Series and that cannot be satisfied or provided for in full by or out of assets of the Trust other than assets belonging to each particular Series (collectively, "General Liabilities"), the  Administrator may allocate such General Liabilities, only to the extent that the same cannot be satisfied or provided for in full by or out of assets of the Trust other than assets belonging to each particular Series, to, between, or among any one or more Series in such manner and on such basis as the  Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, any General Liabilities so allocated to a particular Series shall belong to that Series and that Series only and each such allocation by the  Administrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the Trust, all Series and all holders of Interests for all purposes.<br>
				(e)All Persons extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim against the Trust shall look only to the assets belonging to the Series with which such Person dealt for payment under such credit, contract or claim, and not to assets belonging to any other Series or to assets of the Trust generally; and the holders of Interests of such Series, any other Series, or of the Trust generally, the Administrator, the Trustee, the Sponsor, or any officers, directors, employees or agents, whether past, present or future, of the Trust, the Trustee, the Administrator, or the Sponsor shall not be personally liable therefor.  Every note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate or undertaking and every other act or thing whatsoever executed or done by or on behalf of the Trust or any Series, by or on behalf of the Administrator or the Trustee as such in connection with the Trust shall be conclusively deemed to have been executed or done only by, for, or on behalf of the Trust (or the applicable Series), and not personally, and no recourse shall be had to the Administrator, the Sponsor, or the Trustee individually.<br>
				(f)Any note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate or undertaking made or issued by the Trust, the Administrator, the Trustee, or any officer of the Trust may give notice that the same was executed or made by or on behalf of the Trust or by such Person in the indicated capacity and not individually and that the obligations of such note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate or undertaking are not binding upon any of them individually but are binding only upon the assets and property of the Trust, or assets belonging to the particular Series in question, as the case may be, but the omission thereof shall not operate to bind or impose liability on any Series not otherwise liable therefor, or on any Administrator, Trustee, or officer, employee or agent, or Plan Participant individually, or otherwise invalidate any such note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate or undertaking.<br>
				<br>
				Section 4.2 Plan Participants.  <br>
				The beneficial interest of a Plan Participant in the Trust Property of each Series of which such Plan Participant owns an Interest shall be recorded by the Trustee in the register identifying the Plan Participant(s) of such Series maintained by the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii)(A) (each such register, a "Series Register"), which Series Registers shall be maintained separately as separate and distinct records for each Series that has been established.  No certificate evidencing the beneficial interest of a Plan Participant is required to be issued except as the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator in its sole discretion may otherwise determine from time to time and instruct the Trustee in writing, in which case the Administrator may make such rules as it considers appropriate for the issuance of such certificates, the use of facsimile or conformed signatures, the transfer of Interests of Plan Participants and similar matters, subject to the Trustee"s approval.  Such Series Registers maintained by the Trustee shall be conclusive as to who are the Plan Participants with respect to each Series, except in case of manifest error.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary, prior to the Trustee receiving written direction from or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee pursuant to Section 4.1(b) to revise the Series Register(s) maintained by the Trustee, the Trustee may treat (and shall be fully protected (as such and in its individual capacity) in treating) the Plan Participant(s) identified in such Series Register(s) as the absolute beneficial owners of the Trust and/or with respect to a Series, for all purposes, and in no event shall the Trustee (as such or in its individual capacity) be bound by any notice to the contrary.  Each Plan Participant hereby represents and warrants that it is not: (a) a citizen or resident of the United States of America; (b) a corporation or other entity deemed situated in the United States of America under the tax laws and Regulations of the United States of America; or (c) physically present in the United States of America for a number of days in a taxable year which would result in it being taxable as a resident alien under the "substantial presence" test of Section 7701(b) of the Code.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Plan Participant (a) becomes a citizen or resident of the United States of America, (b) becomes a corporation or other entity which is deemed situated in the United States of America under the tax laws and Regulations of the United States of America, or (c) is physically present in the United States for a number of days in a taxable year which would result in such Plan Participant being taxable as a resident alien under the "substantial presence" test of Section 7701(b) of the Code (an event described in (a), (b), or (c) of this Section, a "Tax Termination Event"), then such Person thereupon shall cease to be a Plan Participant and a beneficial owner of the Trust, such Person shall be, and shall have only the rights of, a creditor of the relevant Series, the Interest of such Person shall automatically terminate and shall be deemed cancelled, and the Trust shall not make any distributions to such former Plan Participant in its capacity as a Plan Participant or beneficial owner of the Trust at any time thereafter.  Each Plan Participant further understands, acknowledges, and agrees that the occurrence of a Tax Termination Event may result in material adverse tax consequences and that neither the Administrator, the Sponsor, nor the Trustee shall have any personal liability therefor.  <br>
				<br>
				Section 4.3 Investments in the Trust.  <br>
				Subject to the terms of this Agreement, on behalf of the Trust, the Administrator or a delegatee of the Administrator may accept or reject subscriptions for Interests in each Series from such Persons and on such terms as it from time to time authorizes or determines; provided, however, that the Administrator and any delegatee of the Administrator shall not accept such subscriptions from any Person who is a citizen or resident of the United States of America or a corporation or other entity which is deemed situated in the United States of America under the tax laws and Regulations of the United States of America or who is physically present in the United States of America for a number of days in a taxable year which would result in it being taxable as a resident alien under the "substantial presence" test of Section 7701(b) of the Code; and provided further that no Interest shall be issued except to a Plan Participant.<br>
				<br>
				Section 4.4 Limitation of Personal Liability.  <br>
				Interests shall be deemed to be personal property and the Plan Participants who are holders thereof shall have only the rights provided in this Agreement and in the corresponding Supplemental Agreement creating such rights.  Every Plan Participant by virtue of becoming a Plan Participant shall be held to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms hereof and to have become a party hereto and bound hereby.  The death, incapacity, dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of a Plan Participant, the Trustee, the Administrator, any delegatee of the Administrator, or the Sponsor during the continuance of the Trust shall not operate to dissolve or terminate the Trust or any Series nor entitle a Plan Participant to an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against the Trust, the Trustee, the Administrator, such delegatee, or the Sponsor.<br>
				<br>
				Section 4.5 Transfer of Interests.  <br>
				No Interest, in the Trust generally or of a Series, shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except: (a) with the written approval of or on behalf of the Administrator and upon the transferee"s written agreement, delivered to the Trust, to be bound by this Agreement and any relevant Supplemental Agreement; and (b) to a Person who is already or becomes a Plan Participant.  Any transfer of an Interest other than in accordance with the foregoing shall be ineffective.  For purposes of this Section, an approval of or on behalf of the Administrator (i) that is in the form of an e-mail, that is sent by or on behalf of the Administrator and is actually received by the Trustee at an e-mail address of the Trustee previously provided by the Trustee to the Administrator, and of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, or (ii) that is in the form of an Electronic Record which the Trustee previously has consented in writing to receive from the Administrator, and that is sent by or on behalf of the Administrator and is actually received by the Trustee, shall be deemed to be a written approval of or on behalf of the Administrator delivered to the Trust, and an agreement of the transferee (iii) that is in the form of an e-mail, that is sent by the transferee and is actually received by the Trustee at an e-mail address of the Trustee previously provided by the Trustee to the transferee, and of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, or (iv) that is in the form of an Electronic Record which the Trustee previously has consented in writing to receive from the transferee, and that is sent by the transferee and is actually received by the Trustee,  shall be deemed to be a written agreement of the transferee delivered to the Trust.<br>
				<br>
				Section 4.6 Limitation on Information.  <br>
				To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, any Supplemental Agreement, or any Subscription Agreement to the contrary, a Plan Participant shall have no right or power to request, demand or obtain, and the Trust, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Administrator (and any delegatee of the Administrator) shall have no obligation to furnish to such Plan Participant: (a) a copy of any Supplemental Agreement other than the Supplemental Agreement to which such Plan Participant is a party and pursuant to which the Series in which such Plan Participant holds an Interest is established and designated; (b) a copy of any Subscription Agreement other than the Subscription Agreement to which such Plan Participant is a party; (c) the name and address of, or any business, financial or other information regarding, any other Plan Participant or any other beneficial owner of the Trust; and (d) any business, financial or other information regarding any Series or Interest other than the Series and Interest with which such Plan Participant is associated.<br>
				<br>

Every note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate or undertaking and every other act or thing whatsoever executed or done by or on behalf of the Trust or any Series, by or on behalf of the Administrator or the Trustee as such in connection with the Trust shall be conclusively deemed to have been executed or done only by, for, or on behalf of the Trust (or the applicable Series), and not personally, and it shall be conclusively deemed that the obligations of such note, bond, contract, instrument, document, certificate, undertaking, or other act or thing are not binding upon the Trustee, the Administrator, the Sponsor, the beneficial owners of the Trust generally (if any), or the Plan Participants individually but are binding only upon the assets and property of the Trust, or the particular Series in question, as the case may be.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Trustee shall not be personally liable under any circumstances, except to the Trust or the Plan Participants for the Trustee"s own willful misconduct, bad faith, or gross negligence.  Subject to Section 5.3 and except for other obligations of the Administrator and/or the Sponsor to the Trustee (as such and/or in its individual capacity), to the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the Administrator nor the Sponsor shall be personally liable under any circumstances, except to the Trust or the Plan Participants for its own willful misconduct, bad faith, or gross negligence.<br>
				<br>
				Section 5.2 Good Faith Actions; Expert Advice; No Bond or Surety.  <br>
				The exercise by the Trustee of its powers hereunder shall be binding upon every interested party.  The Trustee shall not be personally liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law.  In addition to the foregoing: (a) the Trustee shall not be personally responsible or liable in any event for any neglect or wrongdoing of the Administrator or Sponsor, any delegatee of the Administrator, or any officer, agent, employee, consultant, adviser, administrator, distributor or principal underwriter, custodian or accounting agent of the Trust, nor shall the Trustee be personally responsible or liable for the act or omission of any other Person; (b) the Trustee may consult with attorneys, accountants, auditors, and other skilled Persons to be selected and employed by it, and shall not be personally liable for anything done, suffered, or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such attorneys, accountants, auditors, or other skilled Persons or for the Trustee"s failure to follow any such advice or opinion; and (c) in performing its powers and duties, the Trustee, when acting in good faith, may rely (and shall be fully protected (as such and in its individual capacity) in relying) upon the books and records of the Trust (including, without limitation, any Series Register maintained by the Trustee) and upon written reports made by or on behalf of the Administrator or its delegatee or Sponsor, or any officer or agent of the Trust, any accountant or other skilled Person, and any other appropriate Person.  The Trustee (as such and in its individual capacity) shall not be required to give any bond or surety or any other security for the performance of its duties.  To the extent that, at law or in equity, the Trustee has duties (including, without limitation, fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust, to the beneficial owners of the Trust generally (if any), or to a Plan Participant, the Trustee shall not be personally liable to the Trust, to the beneficial owners of the Trust generally (if any), or to any such Plan Participant, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for the Trustee"s good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.  The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties (including, without limitation, fiduciary duties) and liabilities of the Trustee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Trustee, the Sponsor, the Administrator, and the Plan Participants to replace such other duties (including, without limitation, fiduciary duties) and liabilities to the fullest extent permitted by law (including, without limitation, Section 3806(c)(2) of the Act).<br>

				Section 5.3 Indemnification of Trustee. <br>
